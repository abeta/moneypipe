Money Pipe is registered in England as a limited liability company.  Incorporated in 2009, we are relatively new but committed to grow and in the process give our customers a fantastic service that they will struggle to find elsewhere.

A small dedicated team based in Brighton (East Sussex) is responsible for all our UK operations.

An equally dedicated team based in Banjul takes care of services in The Gambia.

The relatively small teams dealing with you as a customer allow us to communicate and serve you in a hassle-free, relaxed and personal level but with the professionalism you would expect from the best in the business.

## A business with a difference

We acknowledge and understand the vast difference in the Economic capabilities of the two countries that we operate in (The Gambia and The United Kingdom).

As a business, we are committed to; first and foremost, satisfying the needs of our customers but at the same time prepared to contribute towards the socio-economic advancement of the less privileged communities we are based.

We pledge up to 4% space (volume) of every shipping container destined to the Gambia, reserved to transport items (free of charge), if they are intended for charity to local communities in the Gambia.

We welcome any individual or organisation to use that space (free of charge) as long as the items are intended for charity. Our team in the Gambia can also assist (free of charge) in the distribution of such items where the donor may not be able to arrange for or handle such matters. For more information please see our CHARITY WORK SECTION.
