## Roll-on, Roll-off Service

Roll-on, Roll-off is the term used to describe shipping vehicles where it is driven up a ramp into an area of the ship's hold and then driven off, at the end of the journey. There are limited risks during transit but is a safe and most cost effective way of shipping vehicles abroad.

## Containerised Service

Vehicles can also be placed inside shipping containers, securely strapped and transported safely to their destination. This method is the safest and most secure but may cost up to three times more, compared to the Ro-Ro Service.
