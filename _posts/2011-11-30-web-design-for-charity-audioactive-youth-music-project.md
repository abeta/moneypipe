Local Brighton charity AudioActive needed a new website designed to promote their youth music project and reach more funders. They have done great work helping underpriviledged kids in Brighton nurture their creative talents and give them an opportunity to make it as performing artists, their most recent success story being the urban music duo Rizzle Kicks.

Coming from a music background we at ABE Media were thrilled to help them by setting up a content management system to their specifications free of charge.
